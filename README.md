Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client this project was created for is DriverPass, the goal of this program was to create an online learning management system (LMS) that will be used to schedule their driving services. This system will give users a way to practice for their driving test independently from driver's ed. Users will choose from one of three listed packages and begin their journey of practice prior to their driving test. This system will track the user's progress and allow other users to interact through feedback, lessons or material changes. The major idea behind this system was to fill a gap in the driving market. The hope is that with this program it will cut down the amount of people who go take their test at the DMV and fail the first time.

What did you do particularly well?

Something I did particularly well in this project was working with the new process diagrams that were introduced such as activity diagrams and class diagrams. I had some experience with these sort of diagrams before but never enough where I felt truly confident in my ability to create one and use it for a project on my own. Throughout the course I felt my skills begin to develop and grow, now I feel like I could take these skills and apply them to any project I am working on in the future.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

One part of this project I would look to improve on the actual details of some things on my UML Diagram. Overall I think I did a pretty good job on this project but one thing I could've improved on was making my UML diagram more tidy and using the correct figures to represent the actors in this workflow process. The content and ideas were all in the right place I just needed to take some more time and make sure that everything is in a organized manner so that people who have never worked on or seen the project before would be able to come in and pick up right where I left off.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpeted the user's needs by looking at the requirements DriverPass had provided for me and also trying to put myself in the shoes of a user and design things in a way that is user friendly and helpful to the program from both the admin and the customer side of things. It is so important to consider user needs because at the end of the day that's the whole reason the project is being created, users use a program with a solution to their problem in mind so if we designed a system that offered no solution why would anyone want to use it?

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

The best approach when designing software has to be keeping the user in mind. If the user is happy with the end product there isn't too much to ask for since that is who the program is being created for. Some strategies I would use are the diagrams we have had intorduced to us, it allows us to break down functions, classes, features and the overall plan of the project and using those to plan will make everyone's job slightly easier.
